  Hi, I'm Surya, currently a final year student pursuing a B.Tech degree in Computer Science and Engineering at [SRM Institute of Science and Technology, Kattankulathur, Chennai](https://www.srmist.edu.in/). I am currently working as a Research Intern (Computer Vision) at the Department of Translational Medicine and Research at SRM Medical College and Research Centre. I am  interested in the field of Deep Learning and Computer Vision. I've worked on several Computer Vision projects and have hands-on experience and knowledge in various Deep Learning Architectures. I'm looking forward to implementing Deep Learning in various fields such as Medical, Self Driving vehicles, Security, etc..
