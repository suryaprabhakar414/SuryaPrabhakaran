    #Short overview of the project
  description: >
    * Performed Stereo Reconstruction on the KITTI Stereo 2015 dataset. 
    
    * Implemented Block Matching, Semi Global Matching for generating the disparity maps and also used SIFT, SURF and ORB for keypoint matching, triangulation and generation of point clouds.

  description: >
    * Developed the application using Intel Distribution of the OpenVINO Toolkit.
    
    * This app control the movement of mouse pointer by the direction of eyes and also estimates pose of the head.
    
    * This app takes video as input(video file or camera) and then estimates the gaze of the userâ€™s eyes and change the mouse pointer position accordingly.

  description: >
    * Developed the application using Intel Distribution of the OpenVINO Toolkit.
    
    * This app detects and counts the number of people in a particular queue and redirects them to a less congested queue.

    * Worked on Intel DevCloud to implement the project on several hardwares[CPU, IGPU, VPU(NCS2),FPGA].

  description: >
    * Developed the application using Intel Distribution of the OpenVINO Toolkit.
    
    * This app calculates:-
      * the number of people in the frame
      * time spent by those people in the frame
      * the total number of people counted  <br />
      
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and sends this data to a MQTT server.
