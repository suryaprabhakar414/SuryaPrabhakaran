  name: Active Learning with Gaussian and Heuristic Features for 3D Object Detection
  github: 
  dates: July 2024 - Jan 2025
  description: >
      * Developed a novel Active Learning (AL) strategy for LiDAR-based 3D object detection.
      * Designed an architecture-agnostic approach with a unified uncertainty score, combining localization and classification uncertainty.
      * Achieved an mAP of 70.34% with 25% of labeled KITTI data.
      * Containerized the entire pipeline using Docker for reproducibility and seamless deployment, enabling scalable experimentation and model training.

    #Short overview of the project
  description: >
    * Developed the application using Intel Distribution of the OpenVINO Toolkit.
    
    * This app control the movement of mouse pointer by the direction of eyes and also estimates pose of the head.
    
    * This app takes video as input(video file or camera) and then estimates the gaze of the user’s eyes and change the mouse pointer position accordingly.
