    #Short overview of the project
  description: >
    Developed using Intel Distribution of the OpenVINOTM Toolkit. This app is used to control the movement of mouse pointer by the direction of eyes and also estimated pose of the head. This app takes video as input(video file or camera) and then estimates the gaze of the userâ€™s eyes and change the mouse pointer position accordingly.

  description: >
    Developed using Intel Distribution of the OpenVINOTM Toolkit and Intel DevCLoud.Smart Queuing System app is used to reduce queue congestions. This app detects and counts the number of people in a particular queue and redirects them to a less congested queue. I have used Intel DevCloud to implement the project on several hardwares[CPU, IGPU, VPU(NCS2), FPGA]

  name: People Counter App
  github: /suryaprabhakar414/People-Counter-App-OpenVINO.git
  description: >
    Developed using Intel Distribution of the OpenVINOTM Toolkit. The App performs inference on an input video, extracting and analyzing the output data, then sending that data to a server. The model is deployed on the edge, such that only data on:-
    1) the number of people in the frame
    2) time those people spent in frame
    3) the total number of people counted are sent to a MQTT server.
